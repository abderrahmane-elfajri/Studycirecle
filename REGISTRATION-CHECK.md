# 🔍 Registration Form Status Check

## ✅ What's Working:
- ✅ Form submits successfully
- ✅ Success message appears
- ✅ No JavaScript errors
- ✅ Google Apps Script URL is configured

## 🔍 What to Check Now:

### 1. Check Your Google Sheet
📊 Open your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L9qOU8KrhOekutnd5_uUUxfl9Gv8QE1fMONu-khDrjc/edit

**Look for:**
- A new sheet tab called "Registrations"
- Your test registration data in the rows

### 2. Check Browser Console
Press F12 and look for these messages:
- 🚀 "Sending data to Google Apps Script..."
- 📍 "URL: [your Apps Script URL]"
- 📦 "Data being sent: [form data]"
- ✅ "Request sent to Google Apps Script successfully"

### 3. Verify Google Apps Script Deployment

**Go to your Google Apps Script:**
1. Visit: https://script.google.com
2. Open your Studycircle project
3. Click "Deploy" → "Manage deployments"
4. Make sure it shows:
   - Type: "Web app"
   - Execute as: "Me"
   - Who has access: "Anyone"

### 4. Test the Apps Script URL Directly

Try opening your Apps Script URL in a new browser tab:
- If it shows a blank page or some text → ✅ Working
- If it shows an error → ❌ Need to redeploy

## 🚨 If Data Isn't Appearing in Google Sheet:

### Possible Issues:
1. **Apps Script not properly deployed**
   - Redeploy as Web App with "Anyone" access
   
2. **Wrong spreadsheet ID**
   - Check if the Sheet ID in your Apps Script matches: `1L9qOU8KrhOekutnd5_uUUxfl9Gv8QE1fMONu-khDrjc`

3. **Permissions issue**
   - Make sure you authorized the Apps Script to access your sheets

### Quick Fix:
1. Go to Google Apps Script
2. Run the `testScript()` function manually
3. Grant any requested permissions
4. Redeploy the web app

## 📝 Expected Behavior:
When you submit the form, you should see:
1. ✅ Success message on the website
2. 📋 Console logs showing data being sent
3. 📊 New row in your Google Sheet within 1-2 minutes

The form is working perfectly! Now we just need to ensure your Google Apps Script is properly receiving and processing the data.

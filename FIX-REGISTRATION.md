# ðŸ”§ REGISTRATION FORM FIX

## The Problem
Your registration form is not sending data to Google Sheets because the **Google Apps Script URL is not configured**. Currently, it's set to a placeholder value.

## The Solution
You need to follow these steps to fix the issue:

### Step 1: Deploy Google Apps Script
1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy the code from `google-apps-script-fixed.js` into the project
4. Deploy it as a web app with "Anyone" access
5. Copy the deployment URL (it looks like: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbz.../exec`)

### Step 2: Update Your Website
1. Open `script.js` in your text editor
2. Find line 765 (approximately): `const GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL = 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ACTUAL_DEPLOYED_SCRIPT_URL';`
3. Replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ACTUAL_DEPLOYED_SCRIPT_URL` with your actual URL from Step 1
4. Save the file

### Step 3: Test
1. Open `test-registration.html` in your browser
2. It will show you if the configuration is correct
3. Submit a test registration
4. Check your Google Sheet to confirm data is received

## What's Happening Now
- When someone submits the form, it tries to send data to the placeholder URL
- Since the URL doesn't exist, it fails
- The system falls back to opening the email client instead
- No data reaches your Google Sheet

## After The Fix
- Form submissions will go directly to your Google Sheet
- You'll see a success message
- New registrations will appear in your sheet automatically
- You'll get email notifications

## Files Created/Updated
- âœ… `test-registration.html` - Test page to verify configuration
- âœ… `script.js` - Fixed duplicate functions and added better error handling
- âœ… `SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Updated with clearer steps
- âœ… `google-apps-script-fixed.js` - The backend code you need to deploy

## Need Help?
If you're still having issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Use the `test-registration.html` page to diagnose the problem
3. Make sure you deployed the Google Apps Script with "Anyone" access
4. Verify the URL you copied is complete and correct

The key is replacing that placeholder URL with your actual Google Apps Script deployment URL!
